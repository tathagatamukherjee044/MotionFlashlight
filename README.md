# MotionFlashlight

This app when running uses a service that detects changes in accelerometer controls the flashlight of an smartphone.<br>
Users can turn on/off the flashlight without opening the phone. A karate chop action can be performed to turn on the light(lots of terms and conditions apply).<br>
For now the app runs only when it is active (i think till the app is not killed i dont know much about android activity lifecycle).<br>

#### Next steps:<br>
. Make the app always running in the background<br>
. Add S.O.S feature<br>
. Add blinking light feature
